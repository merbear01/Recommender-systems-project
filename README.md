# Content-Based Recommender Systems Analysis
This repository contains the research and implementation of content-based recommender systems, particularly focusing on the comparison between content-based and collaborative filtering techniques using datasets from Netflix and MovieLens.

# Project Overview
Recommender systems have become essential in navigating the vast amount of content available online, providing personalized suggestions to users. This project delves into content-based filtering, which recommends items by analyzing item features similar to those the user has liked in the past.

# Key Features
Implementation of a content-based recommender using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
Comparative analysis of content-based vs. collaborative filtering using execution time and accuracy metrics.
Exploration of the implications of using different types of recommender systems on large datasets like Netflix and MovieLens.

# Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for analysis.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.


# Data Sources
